# Binary_Search_Trees
In here I'll apply basic computational algorithms to create a binary search tree.

11/8 In here I've created the following methods:
  #insert;
  #delete;
  #find;
  #level_order;
  #inorder;
  #preorder;
  #postorder;
  #height;
  #depth;
  #balanced?;
  #rebalance;
  
The traversal methods were particularly difficult.
